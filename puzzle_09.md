# Puzzle 9: Sinterklaas's Naughty/Nice Decision Engine

## Puzzle Description

The user is presented with a whimsical, interactive "Naughty/Nice Decision Engine" built from cardboard cutouts, representing a series of interconnected logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). Each input to this "engine" corresponds to a specific Sinterklaas-related criterion (e.g., "Child wrote letter to Sinterklaas?", "Child ate all pepernoten?", "Child helped Zwarte Piet?"). The user's task is to manipulate the state of these inputs (TRUE/FALSE, based on a provided scenario or a set of rules) to achieve a desired final output, typically "NICE" (TRUE) or "NAUGHTY" (FALSE). The puzzle's answer is a specific Sinterklaas-themed word or phrase that appears when the circuit reaches the correct, desired output state.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Directly uses the central Sinterklaas tradition of determining who is naughty or nice, making abstract logic gates tangible and fun within the Pakjesavond context.
*   **Neal.fun Inspiration:** This is a clear application of "Interactive Diagrams/Simulations." The logic gates are visual and manipulable, allowing the user to experiment and understand the flow of information. It could involve clicking switches, observing lights, and seeing immediate feedback, highly reminiscent of `neal.fun`'s engaging interactive experiences.

## Design Notes

"Create a Sinterklaas-themed logic gate puzzle.
1.  Define 3-5 boolean inputs, each corresponding to a 'child's behavior' or a Pakjesavond condition (e.g., `has_polished_shoes`, `wrote_wish_list`, `shared_pepernoten`, `slept_through_night`). Assign initial TRUE/FALSE values based on a fictional child's profile.
2.  Design a logic circuit using AND, OR, and NOT gates (at least 3-4 gates) that processes these inputs to ultimately determine a final 'Naughty' or 'Nice' output.
3.  The puzzle requires the user to figure out what combination of inputs leads to the desired 'NICE' outcome (or to explain why a specific child ended up 'NAUGHTY').
4.  The answer will be a Sinterklaas-themed word or phrase associated with the final 'NICE' state (e.g., 'Gift Delivered', 'Well Behaved', 'Amerigo's Approval'). Provide the full logic circuit definition, the initial input values, and the exact answer."

## Expected Answer/Solution

The specific Sinterklaas-themed word or phrase associated with the desired output state.

## Hint

"Sinterklaas weighs every action, and his logic is always fair."
