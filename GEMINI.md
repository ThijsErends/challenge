# Gemini Project: The Labyrinth of the 4-Digit Goat

This file provides the context for the Gemini CLI to assist in the development of this project.

## Project Overview

This project is a personalized digital gift for my sister, a "tool creator" in the tech world. It's a "Santa Claus gift exchange" app disguised as a labyrinth of 10 interconnected puzzles. The ultimate goal is for her to solve all the puzzles and receive a 4-digit code (which we'll playfully call the "4-Digit Goat"). This code will unlock a physical lockbox containing her Christmas present.

The app will be presented as a website, and the puzzles are designed to be a fun, engaging, and challenging experience. The tone should be mysterious and slightly whimsical, with a narrative that unfolds as she progresses through the labyrinth.

## Key Files

*   `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: The main context file for the project. It contains the project vision, target audience, core features, narrative, puzzle outline, and technical implementation details.
*   `puzzle_01.md` to `puzzle_10.md`: These files will contain the details for each of the 10 puzzles, including the prompts for Google AI Studio.
*   `INITIAL_PROMPTS.md`: This file will contain the initial prompts to set up the project in Google AI Studio.

## Development with Google AI Studio

This project is designed to be developed with the help of Google AI Studio. The `.md` files in this project are intended to be used as prompts and context for the AI.

*   **Prompts:** The `puzzle_*.md` files and `INITIAL_PROMPTS.md` contain the prompts to be used in Google AI Studio to generate the content for the app.
*   **Context:** The `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` file provides the overall context for the AI.

## Git Operations Policy

**IMPORTANT:** All Git operations (cloning, committing, pushing, etc.) for this project will be handled by the user locally. The Gemini CLI should **NOT** attempt to execute any `git` commands (e.g., `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push`) as this project uses a private repository and the CLI does not have the necessary authentication. The CLI's role will be to assist with file creation, modification, and content generation within the local project directory.

This `GEMINI.md` file will be updated as the project progresses.
