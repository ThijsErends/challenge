# The Labyrinth of the 4-Digit Goat 🐐

A personalized digital puzzle challenge designed as a "Santa Claus gift exchange" experience. This web-based labyrinth consists of 10 interconnected puzzles that must be solved to reveal a final 4-digit code, unlocking a physical treasure.

## 🎨 Visual Style: "The Cardboard Arcade"

The project features a unique **"Cardboard Arcade"** aesthetic:
*   **Handmade Feel:** Everything looks like flat colored construction paper cut out with scissors.
*   **Typography:** Marker-style headings and handwritten notes.
*   **Animation:** Buttons and elements have a playful "wiggle" to keep the world alive.
*   **No Textures:** Depth is achieved purely through flat colors and hard, crisp shadows.

## 🧩 The Challenge

The user starts at the landing page and must navigate through:
1.  **10 Unique Puzzles:** Ranging from riddles to logic games.
2.  **Sequential Progression:** Solving one puzzle unlocks the next.
3.  **The Final Reward:** A 4-digit code (The "Goat") to open the real-world gift.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure for puzzles.
*   **CSS3:** Custom variables, animations, and layout (no frameworks).

*   **GitHub Pages:** Automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
