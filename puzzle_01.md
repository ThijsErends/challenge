# Puzzle 1: Piet's Perfect Pepernoot

## Puzzle Description

Zwarte Piet is renowned for many talents, but drawing a perfectly round pepernoot isn't one of them. The user is tasked with assisting Piet by drawing a circle as perfectly as possible within a designated drawing area. The puzzle requires the user to achieve a minimum accuracy of 80% when drawing a circle with their mouse or touch input. The visual style will remain consistent with the 'Cardboard Arcade' theme, with the drawing area appearing as a piece of baking parchment or a section of a pepernoot recipe.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Directly involves Zwarte Piet and the iconic pepernoot, making the abstract task concrete and fun within the Pakjesavond context.
*   **Neal.fun Inspiration:** Directly inspired by `neal.fun/perfect-circle`, focusing on a simple, satisfying, and skill-based interactive challenge.

## Design Notes

"Design 'Piet's Perfect Pepernoot' puzzle.
1.  Describe the visual interface: a drawing area on a 'parchment paper' texture, with Sinterklaas-themed elements around it (e.g., a wobbly drawing of Piet trying to draw a circle, a recipe card for pepernoten).
2.  Explain the interaction: the user draws a circle with their mouse/finger.
3.  Specify the success condition: achieving at least 80% accuracy compared to a mathematically perfect circle.
4.  The password will be a specific Sinterklaas-related word that appears upon successful completion. (e.g., 'pepernoot', 'perfect', 'rond').
5.  Provide the exact password for this puzzle."

## Expected Answer/Solution

The specific Sinterklaas-related word (e.g., 'pepernoot') revealed upon achieving 80% or higher circle drawing accuracy.

## Hint

"Even the best bakers need a steady hand for the perfect shape."
