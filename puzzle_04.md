## Prompt for Google AI Studio

"Write a short poem in the style of pseudo-code. The poem should describe a simple algorithm. The final line of the poem should be `RETURN final_word`. The algorithm should involve taking a common word (like 'hello'), reversing it, and appending a number. The 'final_word' is the answer to the puzzle.

Here is an example structure:

```
BEGIN
  word = "example"
  number = 42
  
  IF word.length > 5 THEN
    word = word.reverse()
    word = word + number
  END
  
  RETURN word
END
```

Make the poem more lyrical and less like actual code."

## Expected Answer/Solution

The result of executing the pseudo-code poem.

## Hint

"Read the poem like a computer, and you'll find the answer."
