# Puzzle 4: Amerigo's Algorithm for Arrival

## Puzzle Description

The user is presented with a whimsical "pseudo-code" algorithm, poetically describing Amerigo's (Sinterklaas's white horse) critical journey across the rooftops of a Dutch town on Pakjesavond. This algorithm isn't meant to be strictly executed by a computer but followed logically by the user. It will contain Sinterklaas-themed variables (e.g., `rooftop_count`, `pepernoten_eaten_by_Amerigo`), control structures (e.g., `IF`, `ELSE`, `FOR EACH`), and conditional statements (e.g., `IF child_is_awake THEN // whisper 'ssh...'`). The puzzle's solution is the final "output" or state determined by carefully "executing" this pseudo-code poem.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Centered around Amerigo and Pakjesavond logistics, blending technology with tradition.
*   **Neil.fun Inspiration:** This leans into "Procedural Generation / Algorithmic Art Interaction" where the user manually processes an algorithm to derive an outcome. The poetic nature also touches on "Text Manipulation," but with a logical rather than purely linguistic twist, similar to some of Neil's more thought-provoking interactive narratives.

## Prompt for Google AI Studio

"Write a short, lyrical poem in the style of pseudo-code, describing a Sinterklaas/Amerigo-themed process.
1.  Use Sinterklaas-related variables (e.g., `num_pepernoten_in_bag`, `amerigo_gallop_speed`, `rooftop_height`).
2.  Include simple control flow (e.g., `IF`, `ELSE`, `FOR EACH`).
3.  The 'algorithm' should describe Amerigo's actions or a delivery process.
4.  The final 'RETURN' value or the outcome of the 'algorithm' (e.g., a specific word, a color, or a number) should be the answer.
5.  Make the pseudo-code more poetic and less literal, but still solvable.
6.  Provide the exact expected answer after 'executing' the pseudo-code."

## Expected Answer/Solution

The word, phrase, or number that is the logical outcome of "executing" the pseudo-code poem.

## Hint

"Listen to Amerigo's hooves, they tell the story of his path."
