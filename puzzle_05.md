# Puzzle 5: The Piet's Cipher Wheel

## Puzzle Description

The user is presented with a visual representation of a "Piet's Cipher Wheel"—an interactive, cardboard-styled decryption device. This wheel will consist of two rotatable rings (inner and outer), each displaying letters, numbers, or Sinterklaas-themed symbols. A short, cryptic message, seemingly from a Zwarte Piet to Sinterklaas, will be displayed in an encrypted format. The user's task is to manipulate the cipher wheel, aligning the rings based on a specific Sinterklaas-related clue (e.g., matching Amerigo to the number of presents, or aligning a specific pepernoot pattern). Once correctly aligned, the hidden plaintext message will be revealed, which serves as the answer.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Integrates Zwarte Piet, cryptic messages, and a classic Sinterklaas-era tool for secret communication.
*   **Neil.fun Inspiration:** This is a direct application of "Interactive Diagrams/Simulations" where the user manipulates a visual tool to solve the puzzle. It also touches on "Text Manipulation" as the output is a deciphered message, aligning with Neil's playful and interactive problem-solving style.

## Prompt for Google AI Studio

"Design a simple substitution cipher puzzle using the concept of a 'Piet's Cipher Wheel'.
1.  Create a short, secret Sinterklaas-themed message (e.g., about a hidden gift, a plan for Pakjesavond, or a location).
2.  Encrypt this message using a simple Caesar cipher (shift cipher) or a slightly more complex substitution where the key is easy to understand once revealed.
3.  Formulate a Sinterklaas-themed clue that would help the user determine the correct 'shift' or alignment for the cipher wheel. This clue should be subtle and require a bit of thought (e.g., 'Amerigo trots for 5 more rooftops,' implying a shift of 5, or 'The number of letters in Sinterklaas's name').
4.  Provide the encrypted message, the clear, concise clue for the shift/alignment, and the plaintext answer. The answer should be the decrypted message.
5.  Emphasize that the solution involves physically 'turning' a wheel (metaphorically for the interactive element).
"

## Expected Answer/Solution

The decrypted plaintext message.

## Hint

"Look for the hidden numbers in Sinterklaas's traditions."
