# Puzzle 3: Sinterklaas's Gift Registry Query

## Puzzle Description

The user is presented with a mock "API Documentation" interface for Sinterklaas's highly exclusive "Gift Registry." This documentation will detail various (fictional) endpoints related to Pakjesavond logistics, such as `/pepernoten_count`, `/naughty_nice_status`, or `/present_delivery_manifest`. The challenge lies in sifting through the verbose, whimsical, and slightly confusing technical text to locate a specific "API Key" that grants access to the next stage of the labyrinth. The key might be hidden in an example request, a deprecated section, or a "developer testing" credential.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Directly uses the concept of Sinterklaas's operations, gift delivery, and naughty/nice lists. The "API" is a playful nod to the tech-savvy target audience.
*   **Neil.fun Inspiration:** Leans into "Text Manipulation" (analyzing dense, themed text for specific info) and "Interactive Diagrams/Simulations" (navigating a mock documentation interface, potentially with clickable elements revealing more details). The whimsical nature aligns with neil.fun's style.

## Design Notes

"Generate a short, playful, yet dense 'API Documentation' for 'Sinterklaas's Gift Registry'.
1.  Invent 2-3 API endpoints related to Sinterklaas's operations (e.g., `/check_list_status`, `/get_present_details`, `/request_speculaas`).
2.  For each endpoint, include mock details like: Method (GET/POST), Parameters (e.g., `schoen_id`, `child_name`), Example Request/Response, and Status Codes.
3.  Bury the 'API Key' within the documentation. It should not be immediately obvious. For example:
    *   In a 'Developer Notes' section, mention a default key for 'testing purposes'.
    *   In an example `curl` command, the key is pre-filled.
    *   As a commented-out line in a 'Version History' section.
    *   The key should be a Sinterklaas-themed string (e.g., `piet-power-99`, `steamboat-secret`, `delightful-december`).
4.  The documentation should have a slightly archaic or formal tone mixed with Sinterklaas terminology.
5.  Provide the exact API key string as the solution."

## Expected Answer/Solution

The hidden Sinterklaas-themed API key string (e.g., `piet-power-99`).

## Hint

"The secrets of the registry are often found where developers test their magic."
