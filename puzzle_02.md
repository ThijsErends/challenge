# Puzzle 2: The Rooftop Delivery Route

## Puzzle Description

This puzzle challenges the user to deduce Sinterklaas's secret delivery path across the rooftops of a Dutch town. Visual clues are provided in the form of Zwarte Pieten on various rooftops, each holding a distinctively colored gift bag. The user must identify the correct sequence of Pieten (based on their bag colors) that forms Sinterklaas's optimal, hidden route.

## Inspiration & Theme

*   **Sinterklaas Theme:** Directly integrates Zwarte Pieten, gift bags, and Dutch rooftops, tying into Pakjesavond traditions.
*   **Neal.fun Inspiration:** Combines "Hidden Object" (finding the correct Pieten/colors) with "Interactive Diagram" (deducing a sequence from visual elements).

## Design Notes

"Generate a visual description for 'The Rooftop Delivery Route' puzzle.
1. Describe a stylized, cutout-paper scene of Dutch rooftops at night, with several Zwarte Pieten positioned on them.
2. Each Piet should be holding a uniquely colored gift bag (choose 5-7 distinct colors from the 'Construction Paper Pack' in the STYLE_GUIDE, e.g., Red, Green, Orange, Teal).
3. Create a short, poetic hint (in the style of a Sinterklaas poem) about a 'specific order' or 'hidden path' that connects certain Pieten by their bag color. The hint should gently guide the user without revealing the exact sequence.
4. Define a specific sequence of 4-5 bag colors as the correct delivery route. This sequence should be the password. (e.g., 'red-green-teal-orange'). The password should be the hyphen-separated, lowercase names of the colors."

## Expected Answer/Solution

A hyphen-separated string of the correct sequence of bag colors (e.g., "red-green-teal-orange").

## Hint

"Across the gables, where the moon shines bright,
Follow the hues that bring the gifts of night.
A certain order, soft and sly,
Will show the path where presents fly."
