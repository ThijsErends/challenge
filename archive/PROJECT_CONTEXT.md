# Project Context: The Labyrinth of the 4-Digit Goat

## 1. Project Vision

This project is a personalized digital gift for my sister, a "tool creator" in the tech world. It's a "Santa Claus gift exchange" app disguised as a labyrinth of 10 interconnected puzzles. The ultimate goal is for her to solve all the puzzles and receive a 4-digit code (which we'll playfully call the "4-Digit Goat"). This code will unlock a physical lockbox containing her Christmas present.

The app will be presented as a website, and the puzzles are designed to be a fun, engaging, and challenging experience. The tone should be mysterious and slightly whimsical, with a narrative that unfolds as she progresses through the labyrinth.

## 2. Target Audience

My sister: a tech-savvy individual who appreciates clever puzzles, logic problems, and a good story. She's a "tool creator," so puzzles that mimic or parody technical concepts (like fake APIs, pseudo-code, or data-parsing) will be particularly fitting.

## 3. Core Features

*   **A Web-Based UI:** A simple, clean interface that presents one puzzle at a time.
*   **10 Puzzles:** A sequence of 10 puzzles of increasing difficulty.
*   **Narrative progression:** Each puzzle solved reveals a small piece of a larger story, guiding her deeper into the "labyrinth."
*   **The "4-Digit Goat":** The final reward, a 4-digit number.
*   **Hint System:** Each puzzle will have a subtle hint available.

## 4. The Narrative

The story is about a mischievous digital spirit who has hidden a precious "4-Digit Goat" in the depths of a digital labyrinth. The user is challenged to prove their worth by navigating the labyrinth and "rescuing" the goat. The spirit will communicate with the user, providing a mix of cryptic clues and playful taunts.

## 5. Puzzle Outline

This is a high-level overview of the 10 puzzles. Each puzzle will have its own file with more detailed prompts.

*   **Puzzle 1: The Echoing Entrance:** A simple text manipulation puzzle to introduce the concept of the labyrinth.
*   **Puzzle 2: The Color Maze:** A logic puzzle involving a sequence of colors and directions.
*   **Puzzle 3: The API Key:** A fake API documentation puzzle where she needs to find the "key" in the text.
*   **Puzzle 4: The Pseudo-Code Poem:** A poem written in a pseudo-code style that she needs to "execute" to find the answer.
*   **Puzzle 5: The Encrypted Message:** A simple substitution cipher.
*   **Puzzle 6: The JSON Jungle:** A block of JSON data where she needs to find a specific value hidden within the structure.
*   **Puzzle 7: The CSS Conundrum:** A puzzle where the answer is hidden in a CSS selector.
*   **Puzzle 8: The Regex Riddle:** A riddle that can only be solved by constructing the correct regular expression.
*   **Puzzle 9: The Logic Gate Lullaby:** A logic puzzle based on boolean gates (AND, OR, NOT).
*   **Puzzle 10: The Final Goat:** The final puzzle that reveals the 4-digit code. This will be a culmination of clues from the previous puzzles.

## 6. Technical Implementation

*   **Development:** The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Content:** Each puzzle has its own implementation with specific logic and validation.
*   **Hosting:** The project is deployed to GitHub Pages and can be run locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.

## 7. Development Workflow

*   **Version Control:** Git is used for version control. Changes are committed locally and pushed to the remote repository.
*   **AI Assistance:** This project uses Cursor AI for development assistance. See `.cursorrules` for project-specific guidelines.
*   **Documentation:** All project context, style guidelines, and puzzle specifications are maintained in markdown files.
